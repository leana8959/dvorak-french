# Dvorak-French

Dvorak-French (abbreviated as DvFr) is a custom made keyboard layout, based on dvorak and some ideas from Bépo.  
DvFr uses the exact same alphabetical layout as Dvorak, but switches out the number row in favor of common accents used in the French language.  
This layout is generated using [ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) from SIL.

Main functionalities are:
-   `•` (point médian) for inclusive writing in French, located at <kbd>4</kbd> on a dvorak/qwerty keyboard.
-   Access symbols on normal dvorak/qwerty using <kbd>shift</kbd>
-   Access numbers with <kbd>caps</kbd> activated.
-   Access capital accentuated letters using <kbd>option</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd>
-   Type `€`(Euro) using <kbd>option</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>4</kbd>
-   Type `º`(degree) using <kbd>option</kbd><kbd>0</kbd>

## Availability
Currently made for macOS.
If you’re able to port this layout to other OS, feel free to do so!

## Suggestions 
I’m looking forward to make this keyboard layout better! If you have any idea to improve its functionality or comfort of use, I’m all ears :)
