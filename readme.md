# Dvorak-French

Dvorak-French (abbreviated as DvFr) is a custom made keyboard layout, based on dvorak and some ideas from Bépo.

DvFr uses the exact same alphabetical layout, but switches out the number row in favor for accents used in the French language.

This layout is generated using [ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/) from SIL.

Main functionalities are:

-   `•` symbol for inclusive writing in French.
-   Access to symbols on normal dvorak or qwerty using `shift`
-   Access to numbers using `caps lock`.
-   Access to capital accent letters using `option + shift`
-   Access to `€` using `option + shift + $`
-   Access to `º` using `option + 0`



## Availability 

Currently made for macOS.

## Suggestions 

I’m looking forward to make this keyboard layout better ! If you have any idea to improve its functionality or comfort, I’m all ears !
